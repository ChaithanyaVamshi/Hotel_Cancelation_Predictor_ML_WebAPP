## Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations Using Machine Learning With Python

- Have you ever wondered what if there was a way you could predict which guests who are likely to cancel the reservation at Hotel? That would be great right? Check out this ML model which gives best prediction for the guests who are likely to cancel the reservation.

## 1. Understanding Business Problem
### Hotel Booking Cancellations, A Growing Problemâ€¦
- Hotel Booking Cancellations have a substantial Impact on demand Management Decisions and Revenue in the Hospitality Industry. When Analyzing the past 5 years data, the Global Average Cancellation rate on Hotel Bookings has reached 40% and this trend produces a very negative impact on Hotel Revenue.

- The Goal of this project is to Predict the Guests who are likely to Cancel the Hotel Booking using Machine Learning with Python. Therefore, predicting reservations which might get canceled and preventing these cancellations will create a surplus revenue, better forecasts and reduce uncertainty in business management decisions.

## 2. Data Collection and Understanding

- I've collected the dataset from the kaggle. Dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

This dataset contains booking information for a City hotel and a Resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces etc.

## 3. Data Exploration

- In this step, we will apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract insights from the data set to know which features have contributed more in predicting Cancellations by performing Data Analysis using Pandas and Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn. It is always a good practice to understand the data first and try to gather as many insights from it. Below are tasks to be performed:

1. Importing Libraries
2. Storing the data into MongoDB Database
3. Loading (Fetching) data from MongoDB Database
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on all Features
5. Data Visualisation on all Important Features

## 4. Data Preparation

- After exploring the dataset, we will find a lot of information that will help you prepare the data. Most important steps in Data Preparation are:

1. Handling Missing Values
2. Exploring Numerical and Categorical Features
3. Feature Engineering (Encoding Categorical Features)
4. Feature Selection (Correlation Heat Map)

## 5. Modeling

- The next step now is to build a Machine learning model using a Machine learning Algorithm. In this project, we will build Decision Tree Machine Learning Model using Scikit Learn Library.

1. Model Training
2. Visualizing Decision Trees
3. Feature Importance
4. Model Evaluation
5. Optimizing Model Performance

## 6. Model Deployment

- After building a model, the final stage of the machine learning lifecycle is to deploy the ML model.
- In this project, I have deployed Machine Learning Model on Heroku Cloud using Python and Streamlit. Once we have deployed it on the cloud, we have successfully built a Data Science product that can be used by the Business User/ Customer.
